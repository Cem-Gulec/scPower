CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1.2
-------------------------

o Option to run eQTL power simulation also for larger mean values (only using the function power.eqtl.simulated, not as part of the main pipeline)


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1.1
-------------------------

o Added FDR as additional multiple testing option
o Increased power accuracy of eQTL genes with small mean values by simulation (option can be turned off to speed up calculations)
o Option to skip power calculation of genes with very little expression probability to speed up overall power calculation
